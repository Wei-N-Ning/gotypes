# Objectives

Be useful - less theoretical proofs and reasoning, more examples.

Be helpful - prefer ready-to-use to partial demonstration.

Be practical - the code here is not perfect, not the fastest nor the cleanest, but it works and you can build reliable
things with it.

Borrow the wisdom from others - many lines of code here are inspired by Rust, Python, C++, Haskell, Scala, and so on.

Be a network - hopeful, this project attacts other likeminded developers to make Golang a better type-first programming
language.

Types as the building blocks not an afterthought.
